## Suwako hat

I'm creating Suwako Moriya's hat for [Närcon 2015](http://narcon.se) and decided to make the eyes interactive.

Using an Arduino Uno and 2 [NeoPixel 8x8 LED matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1487) inside spheres,
different eyes and animations will be projected onto the surface of the sphere (from the inside).

I decided to release the code if it's useful for anyone else and will release guides on how to create
the hat itself (if I manage to do it). 

As two NeoPixel matrices are being used, following libraries are required:

* [NeoPixel Library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library)
* [NeoMatrix and GFX Library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/neomatrix-library)
