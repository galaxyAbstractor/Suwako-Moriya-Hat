## Suwako hat

I'm creating Suwako Moriya's hat for [Närcon 2015](http://narcon.se) and decided to make the eyes interactive.

Using an Arduino Uno and 2 [NeoPixel 8x8 LED matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1487) inside spheres,
different eyes and animations will be projected onto the surface of the sphere (from the inside).

I decided to release the code if it's useful for anyone else and will release guides on how to create
the hat itself (if I manage to do it). The current code is using a single-color LED matrix with an
MAX7219 since I do not yet have the NeoPixel, but this will be updated when I got them.
